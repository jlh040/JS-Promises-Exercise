### Number Facts

#### Functionality:

- This is a website that provides four random facts about the number twenty three. The website utilizes the [numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/) to get the information.
- This exercise uses JavaScript Promises. In particular the Promise.all method is used after four API calls are made and their responses are pushed into an array. Once all four promises are resolved, the Promise.all method will resolve, and then I begin to use the data to make Bootstrap cards and display them on the page.

## Technicalities:

- To get this code onto your computer run: `git clone https://github.com/jlh040/JS-Promises-Exercise.git`
- To see what the website looks like, first run the above command, then open the HTML file in your preferred browser.
